Test of GIT gui interface for windows. (5/7/2019)


If you wish to see my use of "branches" in git hub please refer to
my 2d shooter project repository. I Stick with conventional updating
techniques in that repository. Since however this is a simple Portfolio
display page I will usually push updates straight to master, unless in
the future I make major structural changes to the site; in that case I
will branch and then commit to master. (6/4/19)
